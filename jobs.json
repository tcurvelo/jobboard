You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).\r\n\n\nYou love great UX.\u00a0You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code.

We've migrated most of our frontend to React, but we still have some Backbone code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.\nWork closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.\nHelp put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.\nReview code written by other team members or other teams.\nShip to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.\nWork with complex and varied data structures (APIs can be a little, uh, eccentric).\nHelp out with our Python backend or Node-based developer platform.\nShare what you know and learn either one-on-one or with lightning talks to the group.\nGive back to the community via open source and blog posts.\nAs a part of Zapier's\u00a0all-hands philosophy, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.You\u2019ll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier codebase, including core product or platform development.

{"title": "Ruby API/Worker/Backend Engineer (also Java, C++, more) For Holacracy-Powered 16-Person All-Remote SaaS Company", "text": "\n    Hi! We\u2019re Action Verb.We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.Our products include BrickFTP, a hosted file sharing service for business, and Vae Platform, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.Our company consists of 16 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.\r\nOur Success StrategyWe\u2019ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.It\u2019s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here\u2019s how we do it.We Practice HolacracyWe are one of the early adopters of Holacracy, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations. As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.\u201cMost startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.\u201d\u2013 Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTOHolacracy is not unstructured: you\u2019ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You\u2019ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don\u2019t work all the time.Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we\u2019ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.Skillset ExpectationsWe are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:\r\nProgramming experience in several programming languages. We are particularly interested in Ruby, C++, and Java.\r\nStrong Computer Science background and understanding of algorithms and data structures.\r\nSolid web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have lots of backend work to keep several people busy, our business is so web-facing that we think every engineer should be familiar with web technologies.\r\nComplete understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.\r\nAppreciation for testing and the ability to write specs and unit tests\r\nHistory developing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.\r\nMost of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees from a well-regarded university. Our best applicants also tend to have at least 3-5 years experience in a position with direct responsibility for developing and supporting large production applications.\r\nOur Core Beliefs\r\n\r\nWe believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills. Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order to relate to them and support our products at the highest possible level, we should all be engineers too.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide variety of programming language experience. We don\u2019t hire for specific programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be adaptable and ready to evolve to what\u2019s next.With that said, our most immediate need is in Ruby.\u00a0 Java and C++ are also used here.\r\nWe believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to hire. We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they\u2019re located.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work. Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb. Read about everything we\u2019ve done to make working at Action Verb great.\r\nWe believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure. We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React, Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source systems. We don\u2019t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a tool just because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s done around here.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe believe that engineers should support what they build. We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.\r\n\r\nWe believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from scratch while working here that\u2019s generic and not related to our core products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We\u2019ll also pay your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.\r\n\r\nWe believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.Salary and PayAs you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.We fully pay for your health insurance (based on a model plan; exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we\u2019ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work. Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we\u2019ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it\u2019s more than fair, given the value you\u2019ve been able to generate for the company.Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don\u2019t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.If you don\u2019t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path.

{"title": "Front-end Engineer (Design team)", "text": "\n    Hello, there.We\u2019re Help Scout. A company you\u2019ve heard of before, or maybe not, but either way you\u2019ve landed on this page because you were at least a little curious, and we like that about you. We spend our time making it easier for SMBs to talk with their customers. Today Help Scout is used by more than 8,000 businesses in 140 countries.\u00a0We\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s really smart, and humble, and thorough, and meticulous, and self-motivated, and kind, and a little funny, and tenacious, and did I say self-motivated? Well, that\u2019s because we\u2019re a remote company! Being remote is fantastic, it\u2019s empowering, and it\u2019s perfect for people who like to be their own boss and push themselves to be at their very best every day. It\u2019s also perfect for people who hate wearing pants or enjoy going out for ice cream at 4:18pm because it was nice outside and they just felt like it.\u00a0That\u2019s where you come in! If you\u2019re a Front-end Engineer with those qualities, chances are you would love to work at Help Scout.About you\nYou love writing beautiful, scalable, semantic HTML and CSS. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s what you are best at.\n\nYou have a love for design and are at your best partnering with designers to bring a project to life. You take Sketches and Sketch files, transform them into fully-functioning code, making sure every pixel and interaction is perfect and up to spec.\n\nYou love to build things that are intuitive for everyone to use, and you understand that whenever possible, code shouldn\u2019t constrain creativity.\n\nYou are comfortable writing basic JavaScript from scratch, not just implementing a jQuery plugin you found online.\u00a0\n\nYour eye for animation and motion is as strong as your eye for a static design. You have a real knack for implementing these sorts of enhancements as a design comes together.\n\nYou\u2019re a systems thinker, passionate about writing code that scales and stands the test of time. Most importantly, it\u2019s code anyone can understand and enhance without asking you for help.\n\nYou\u2019re always looking for new ways to stay on top of your craft as the industry evolves.\u00a0\n\nYou are pretty psyched about tools like Seed and Jekyll, a couple of open source projects that power our website. We sure do like them a lot.\n\nThe idea of helping to move our business forward on three vectors \u2014 Growth, Content, and Brand \u2014 is really exciting and empowering to you.\n\nAbout the role\nThis role sits on the Design team, not Engineering. Although you love to code, the design/interaction side of things has always been your specialty. We believe code, animation, and interactions are just as central to the design as the pixels are.\n\nYou\u2019ll be spending the majority of your time working on our marketing website, creating new pages, re-working old ones, and generally helping us create a brand experience that resonates with people so much that they want to be a customer.\u00a0\n\nSure, you\u2019ll be writing a lot of code. But we also need someone who can take a step back, see the bigger picture, and look to make an impact on the business as a whole, driving sales, building a beautiful brand that stands out and creates an emotional connection with people.\n\nOn a daily basis you\u2019ll be collaborating with folks from Design and Growth teams, but your tasks will very widely! One day you might be building a new feature page alongside a designer. The next day you might be writing some JavaScript to improve our lightweight A/B testing framework. The next day you might be writing documentation for our style guide or creating PRs to improve Seed. You might even pitch in to create some prototypes for our product every once in a while.\n\nYou'll also have freedom to refactor, implement changes, or develop processes that you feel like will benefit everyone\u2019s workflow. The work you do will help many of your teammates be at their best and work efficiently. Pretty exciting, right?\n\nSince you'll be the most technical person working on the marketing site, many folks will lean on you for advice and direction. You\u2019ll help them level up their coding skills, familiarize them with the codebase, and empower them to work more independently.\n\nYou'll often be responsible for driving(or co-driving) projects forward, communicating with others about tasks and milestones. Your perfectionist tendencies lead you to be quite organized, and a pleasure to work with.\n\nBonus pointsOur marketing site is powered by a single Jekyll instance, which has a complicated build process. It's a delicate dance between tools like Node.js, Ruby, Gulp and some other packages to optimize our website for flexibility, speed, and scale. Having experience with these sorts of environments would be tremendously helpful.Benefits\nCompetitive Salary - We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.\n\nWork anywhere - Work from our office in Boston or anywhere else, provided you have 4 hours of overlap with the team. We\u2019ll even buy your home office furniture or help you pay for a co-working space.\n\nHealth and dental insurance - We cover you and your family's health/dental insurance 100%. If you are based in the US, we'll cover you on our Aetna policy.\n\nLong-term/Short-term Disability Insurance & Life Insurance - we cover 100% of the premiums for LT/ST Disability insurance and base Life Insurance. You also have the option to purchase supplementary life insurance through our provider.\n\nInternational Benefit Stipend - If you\u2019re based outside the US, you\u2019ll receive a monthly stipend that goes towards covering medical insurance, long and short-term disability, and accountant costs.\n\nFlexible vacation - Take time off when you need it, we trust you.\n\nPaid parental leave, including adoption and foster care - 12 weeks for the primary caretaker and 4 week for the secondary caretaker.\n\n401k with 1% match- 1% Retirement Plan matching for both US and International Employees\n\nPersonal development stipend - Up to $1,800 per year to improve your craft\n\nGreat tools - Each employee receives a Mac laptop and 27'' display (or equivalent). We\u2019ll also purchase any of the software or hardware you need as well as high-end furniture to get your home office started\n\nComplete transparency - Everyone has full access to business metrics and financial information about the company.\nAbout UsHelp Scout is made by roughly 70 people in 40+ cities around the world, all with a passion for excellence in their craft.We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences.Since launching in April of 2011, Help Scout now powers 8,000+ support teams in over 140 countries.

You won\u2019t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you\u2019ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.Diversity & InclusionWe are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion.

{"title": "Senior DevOps / Infrastructure Engineer ", "text": "\n    Logikcull might be the most interesting company you haven\u2019t heard of - yet. You probably use Dropbox or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where customers upload entire email databases, nested zip files, images in every conceivable format (and some inconceivable), hard drive exports, and other content described as \u201canything and everything.\u201d Logikcull customers need to understand this data quickly and thoroughly. Simple enough. Put it in S3, right? But here\u2019s the catch, unlike Dropbox, Logikcull must rip the data apart, analyze metadata and text and then restructure it so that legal teams around the world can navigate complex discovery matters. Existing discovery solutions are tired and insufficient. Logikcull is truly something different.This of course requires massive computing, storage, and supporting infrastructure that will surely feel small 6 months from now. Our technical challenges are both broad and deep. Emails have attachments and exist in threaded conversations. A Word document might be a simple letter or embed presentations or even entire email archives (yep, seen it) Almost anything can be printed to PDF.Logikcull is a complex web application that sits on top of a distributed document processing pipeline that handles millions of documents and multiple terabytes of data each month. Current customer growth trends mean we have some serious infrastructure work ahead of us. You are important because we need help on multiple fronts. We must expand document processing capacity and performance, increase system reliability, and improve our security posture. Customers in 34 different countries (and counting) are depending on us.It\u2019s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. Here\u2019s why:The technical challenges are staggering, but the potential impact even small changes can have is incredibly motivating. Last month we shaved 8.5 seconds off of an important document processing step. Multiply that by 10\u2019s of millions of documents and the impact is enormous. Engineers will find opportunities like this over and over.The impact Logikcull is having on our society is likely even more rewarding. For example, our government customers are now responding to open records requests (i.e. FOIA), in days, not months or years (yep, not kidding) by using Logikcull. Citizens lawfully requesting and receiving government information in a timely fashion is crucial for our democracy. We\u2019re committed to making this process better every day.Similarly, we\u2019re committed to changing the economics and logistics of discovery in litigation, which is often prohibitively expensive and complicated for those who need it the most. Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to participate in the discovery process. To us, litigation is sometimes required to affect positive change (see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke) Discovery should not be weaponized. Access to justice should not be means-tested.These are some of the reasons we do it. Do any of them speak to you? Our engineering team would love to meet you.What you'll be doing:\nMake sure our current and future customers can be successful with Logikcull\nResearch, develop and document change plans for new infrastructure initiatives\nImplement architectural change plans, guiding other engineers as needed\nPerform capacity planning and technical risk assessments related to scaling\nStudy and understand our current usage patterns and system behaviors\nDevelop internal heuristics for expansion. \u201cIf ____, then we\u2019ll add another node.\u201d\nSupport backend document processing engineers\nWork with team members to capture and analyze performance metrics\nBuild instances, provision, spec and size underlying resources as needed using modern, cloud-ready infrastructure-as-code solutions.\nPerform data storage analysis and design systems that will handle growth (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, RDS)\nSupport frontend application engineers\nProvide support for centralized application logging\nDevelop CI/CD workflows\nBuild and maintain testing environments\nBe a great Engineering team member\nDebug production issues across services and levels of the stack\nParticipate in a 24x7 on-call rotation\nShare your expertise with us!

SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, LolSoap.Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting accuracy of results?We\u2019ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android.

We have a small team so your voice will be heard\nTech stack and role descriptionOur current mobile applications are hybrid, mixing fully native views with numerous embedded web-views, presenting parts of our mobile website.\u00a0We\u2019re sticking with the hybrid approach (i.e. we don\u2019t intend to ever have fully native apps) but are now transitioning our traditional multi-page web application to a React-powered single-page application. We\u2019re hiring separately for experienced front-end developers to accelerate this transition.Once we\u2019ve transitioned to the SPA, lots of functionality/UX will be identical across our mobile website and applications, but there remain areas where we\u2019ll need to use native functionality.
